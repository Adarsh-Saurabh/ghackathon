# Emotion Cognizance
This is our project for ghackathon submission.

## Problem
We often find that children have difficulty in expressing their feelings. And most often when they are sad or scared of something. Or even in teenagers, they find it difficult to express themselves. These small problems sometimes turn into something really bad.

## Solution
Facial expression system to recognise the expression of child and get the feelings of the child. This will help in places where many children are kept. We can get regular interval data for many children and analyse their growth.
